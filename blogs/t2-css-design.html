    <p>Starting out with CSS, I struggled keeping the difference between margins, borders, and padding straight.  Borders aren't too bad â€“ they're generally used to create visible borders around an element.  But the other two eluded me until very recently.</p>
    <h6>Padding</h6>
    <p>Padding is like an extension of the content itself.  If you want the border or background color of an element to extend further, then increase the element's padding.  This can also create a larger area for users to click if you're manipulating a link.</p>
    <h6>Margins</h6>
    <p>Margins are the invisible buffers that elements can create between themselves and other elements.  They wont affect the reach of borders, background colors, or clickable links.  They serve only to keep spacing between elements.</p>
    <p>Note: Vertical margins may sometimes automatically be collapsed such that two (or more) margins overlap with each other.  This way only one element's margin size will end up determining the space between it and its neighbor.  Padding is never treated this way.</p>
