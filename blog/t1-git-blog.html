        Version control is an integral part of software development, especially for projects created by teams (which most large projects are).  Version Control Systems (VCSs) such as Git, at the most basic level, allow people to track the changes made to their various files.  This is useful for being able to see exactly where and when problems began to occur in a project, as well as to be able to easily revert back to a working version if needed.

        Of course, one should avoid deploying broken updates to begin with.  Features like Git branches allow for just that.  Deployed code can be left as is, while work can continue in a different branch.  Once the new work is up to snuff, you can merge all of your changes back into the main branch.  This is a great way to maintain a project as you work on it.

        Then comes GitHub, the perfect complement to Git's branch/merge capabilities.  GitHub is the largest of many online hubs to host Git repositories (read: directories).  Along with the added safety of storing projects in more than one place, GitHub is an amazing medium through which you can share code and collaborate.  Just as one person might have various branches for different features that they eventually merge into a project, multiple people might work on parts of a project and then merge those changes back into the main project.

        To aid in the collaborative process, GitHub has implemented repo forking, repo cloning, and pull requests.  A person can create a fork on GitHub of another repo and subsequently clone it to their computer, allowing them their own personal versions (both online and locally) of someone else's project.  There they can work on the project, add features, and whatever else as they see fit.  When they feel that they've done enough work to warrant an update to the main program, they have the option of creating a pull request â€“ a request for people working on the main project to review and subsequently incorporate/merge the update into the main project.
    </p>
    <p>
        I feel the only reason some coders don't use a VCS is because of the perceived barrier of entry; command-line Git especially can seem difficult to the uninitiated.  However, with just a bit of help and a couple hours of time one can get proficient enough to see some real benefits.  At the very least they can stop sending zips of their project to people every time they want to share their code.
