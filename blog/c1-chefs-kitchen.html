      From Shereef's talk, it seems like DBC operates much like my college did.  I went to Sarah Lawrence College, where most lessons come in the form of a discussion and students are very involved in directing and expanding their education.  While the discussions probably won't be between more than a few people at a time, most work will apparently done in pairs.

      The thought of pairing so frequently has been one of the more intimidating factors in considering DBC.  I think that I'm generally a sociable person, but I've had some pretty bad experiences working in groups before.  On the other hand, group work can also be really rewarding; I very much enjoy helping people with problems once I've already struggled with and 'solved' them.

      I'm excited to get into this kind of environment.  I think I could really thrive in it.  My only concern is that I can occasionally be very stubborn about my knowledge.  It's not a great trait, and having come from a CS background it may be tough for me to realize that not all of my practices are the best.  I think my desire to learn and my friendly demeanor will win out, though.  Here's hoping for a great couple of months!
