    <h2 class="mb-0 ta-l">About Me</h2>
    <div class="ta-l">
      <p class="mt-0-5em">
        I'm a programmer who loves solving problems and creating playful, open-ended apps.  I spend a lot of time optimizing my environment, be it my code, my workspace, or my keyboard layout.  I'm fascinated by hardware emulation and how programs run at the lowest level.  My current goals are to become a C ninja, to create a Gameboy emulator, and to begin implementing my own mods for gaming hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        At heart I am a gamer.  Growing up with video games, I always wanted to be a part of the industry – specifically to bring the joy and fulfillment to others that many games have brought to me.  As a budding game developer I take my inspiration from games...
      </p>
      <p>
        – that are massive.  Games that are large in scope often leave me awestruck.  As a gamer I want to explore them, and as a developer I want the challenge of working within their complex systems.<br>
        – that are beautiful.  Engaging narratives, alluring aesthetics, and moving scores help me to enjoy a game even when I'm completely removed from the gameplay.<br>
        – that are (online) multiplayer.  I have made real, long-lasting friendships through online games, and I hope to someday provide that same function in the games that I work on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I'm a relaxed person.  I love language studies, tennis, oatmeal stout, and newspaper funnies (think Peanuts or Calvin &amp; Hobbes).  Though I'm generally quiet, I've learned to stress communication when working with others.  Also, I do tend to ramble when I get excited, so I'll gladly talk your ears off over programming, games, or any of my other interests.
      </p>
