    <p><strong>Concrete Perception</strong> enables you to register information directly through your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. When you are using your concrete ability, you are dealing with the obvious, the &quot;here and now.&quot; You are not looking for hidden meanings, or making relationships between ideas or concepts. &quot;It is what it is.&quot;</p>

    <p><strong>Sequential Ordering Ability</strong> allows your mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner. When using your sequential ability, you are following a logical train of thought, a traditional approach to dealing with information. You may also prefer to have a plan and to follow it, rather than relying on impulse.</p>

    <p>My struggles so far at DBC have mostly been related to time management and allocation.  I definitely have a concrete sequential thinking/learning style, which manifests mostly in my desire to focus on the programming aspects of DBC and to get through each step quickly.  I want to learn Ruby sequentially like everyone else, but I also already know how to program so I want to take these steps in strides, rather than slowly get through the material as we also do things like write blog posts.  I feel like it's slowing me down because I generally like to take on one big project and just tackle it as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>One thing I can definitely work on is my abstract perception.  The greatest example for me comes from social interaction â€“ I highly prefer conversation that is blunt and straight to the point.  (I hate when people beat around the bush and imply instead of stating it.  It rarely serves a functional purpose.)  While I don't really care about being more perceptive in regards to intended, implied meanings, I DO need to work on better observing underlying causes for language and social interaction.  For example, in conversation people will generally give plenty of clues about their current mood: I'm bad at reading those.  I don't know how exactly to apply this to my work in DBC, though I suppose thinking about the purpose and implications of various assignments might better motivate me to do them well.</p>
