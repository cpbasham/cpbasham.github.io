  <section>
    <p>I read a lot about the tech industry as a whole, though I generally focus on the game industry (because that's where my heart lies).  I think, out of all their problems, the greatest is that I'm not a part of either industry.  Not enough people have heard about me yet, and they probably aren't going to for another year or so.  This is sad, as people haven't been able to experience the pure programming excellence that I provide.</p>

    <p>In case you can't tell, this is a joke.  I don't know what to write about.  I really feel that this assignment was way too ambiguous.  I have read about tech industry issues before, and I know that there are some really important ones.  I just don't have any motivation to do this right now, and it's way too open-ended for me to be able to knock out quickly.  I don't think I'd be able to get even a paragraph of good content on this page in only an hour and a half, and that's what we're supposed to limit ourselves to.</p>
